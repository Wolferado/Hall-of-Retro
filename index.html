        <h1 id="title">Hall of Retro</h1>
        <h2>What is it?</h2>
        <p>Hall of Retro is a website, that stores information about Retro games that many of us used to play, no matter have we beaten them or not. Dive in here to experience some unique jokes of each game, find some new information and realise how much time has passed since you held your gamepad of retro console.</p>
        <h2>Why do we need it?</h2>
        <p>The main purpose of this website is to take you back into the past of the early 80's - 90's when the grass was greener, the air was clear and the games were challenging and entertaining to play, even if you wanted to smash gamepads after another "Game Over" screen.</p>
